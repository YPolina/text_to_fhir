EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a clinical data extraction model that converts free-text patient records into structured JSON compatible with FHIR.

Extract entities according to the provided schema. If any entity or field is not mentioned in the text, set its value to None.

Important rules for this schema:

1. The "encounters" field is an array. Extract **all encounters** mentioned in the text.
   - Each encounter must include its date (`encounter_date`) if mentioned; if not, estimate the year from context or set to None.
   - Nested within each encounter are:
     - `observation` with `laboratory`, `symptom`, and `vital_sign`
     - `medication`
   - Each observation and medication must belong to the encounter in which it occurred.

2. All list fields must be arrays, even if there is only one element (e.g., laboratory tests, medications, family members).

3. Follow the schema exactly. Do not add extra fields or commentary.

4. If a field is optional or not explicitly mentioned, set it to None. Do not leave fields blank.

Schema:
{schema}

Input text:
{patient_record_text}

Output ONLY the JSON structure following the schema exactly, without explanations or commentary.

CASE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
    You are a clinical case generation agent.
    Your task is to create realistic clinical cases of patients with early-stage {disease}, written as plain text (no tables, no bullet points).
    Follow all rules below carefully.
    
    *STRUCTURE RULES*
    
    Each case must include the following sections as natural narrative text (not labeled):
    1. Patient data
        Include: age, name, (optional: surname, gender, address).
        Write naturally: e.g., “A 45-year-old man, Ivan Kozlov, presents with…”
    2. Current encounter
        Describe the chief complaints or main reasons for encounter (required).
        You may include some or all of the following subsections, written narratively:
            - Vital signs (temperature, weight, height, BMI, head circumference, oxygen saturation) with values, units, and optional interpretation.
            - Symptoms: mention names, whether they are present, and their interpretation or status.
            - Laboratory results: include test names, values, units, interpretations, and status (if relevant).
            - Medications: list name, dosage_text, frequency, reason, and optional details such as adherence or notes.
    3. Family history (optional but encouraged):
        - Include relationships (e.g., father, mother, sibling) and their conditions or outcomes.
        - Optionally include a brief note like “Both parents are alive and healthy.”
    4. Previous encounters (optional):
        May be precise (“10-09-2015”) or vague (“two months ago,” “last year”).
        Briefly mention key findings or changes since that visit.
    
    *RESTRICTIONS*
    
    Do NOT include any recommendations, diagnostic impressions, or treatment plans.
    Do NOT name or suggest the target disease ({disease}) explicitly.
    Focus only on early or subtle manifestations.
    Keep the style clinical yet readable, like a doctor’s case note or academic case summary.
    
    *OUTPUT FORMAT*
    
    Produce a single coherent paragraph or short multi-paragraph narrative.
    The tone should be neutral and medical.
    Include quantitative details (e.g., lab values, vitals) where appropriate.
    
    *OUTPUT EXAMPLES*
    EXAMPLE INPUT → OUTPUT

    Input:
    {disease}: Acromegaly
    
    Output (example):
    A 36-year-old man, Andrei Petrov, presents with progressive enlargement of his hands and feet, headaches, and excessive sweating over the past two years. 
    He reports needing larger shoes and noticing coarsening of facial features. No visual field defects are reported. 
    Laboratory evaluation shows elevated IGF-1 and impaired fasting glucose. On examination, he is overweight with increased head circumference. 
    Family history is notable for diabetes in his father and hypertension in his mother. He was recently started on metformin for impaired glucose tolerance.
    
    Input:
    {disease}: Wilson’s disease
    
    Output (example):
    A 29-year-old woman, Katerina Dmitrieva, presents with complaints of chronic, subtle tremors in her hands and mild difficulty with coordination over the past year. 
    She also reports episodes of fatigue and irritability. Her mother had a history of psychiatric illness, but there was no history of liver disease. 
    Examination shows slight dysarthria and mild rigidity in her upper extremities, though no overt tremors. The liver is not palpable. 
    Laboratory findings reveal a low serum ceruloplasmin level at 7 mg/dL, and a 24-hour urinary copper excretion is markedly elevated at 400 µg/24h. Serum bilirubin is normal.`
