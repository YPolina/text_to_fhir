  text: A 10-year-old boy, Lucas Brooks, presents with complaints of mild clumsiness
    and difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as tying his shoelaces or buttoning
    his shirt, over the past six months. His parents report that he has been experiencing
    occasional episodes of double vision and has had a few instances of dislocating
    his shoulder during physical activities. On examination, his vital signs are within
    normal limits, with a temperature of 98.6°F, weight of 32 kg, height of 140 cm,
    and a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5. His oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.
    Laboratory evaluation shows a slightly elevated homocysteine level of 15 µmol/L
    and a methionine level of 25 µmol/L. He is currently not taking any medications.
    His family history is notable for his mother having a history of blood clots during
    pregnancy and his father having high blood pressure. Both parents are alive and
    healthy otherwise. During his previous encounter two months ago, Lucas had a normal
    eye examination, but his parents have since noticed an increase in his clumsiness
    and frequency of dislocating his shoulder.

  text: A 10-year-old boy, Lucas Brooks, presents with complaints of mild clumsiness
    and difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as tying his shoelaces or buttoning
    his shirt, over the past six months. His parents report that he has been experiencing
    some subtle vision problems, including occasional double vision and blurred vision,
    particularly in the morning. On examination, his vital signs are within normal
    limits, with a temperature of 98.6°F, weight of 32 kg, height of 140 cm, and BMI
    of 16.2. His head circumference is slightly above average at 55 cm. Oxygen saturation
    is 98% on room air. He exhibits mild bilateral lens dislocation, with his lenses
    being superiorly and temporally displaced. Laboratory evaluation shows a slightly
    elevated homocysteine level at 15.6 μmol/L and a methionine level of 25 μmol/L.
    His complete blood count and blood chemistry are otherwise unremarkable. He is
    currently not taking any medications. Family history is notable for a maternal
    uncle with a history of thromboembolic events at a young age and a paternal grandmother
    with a history of osteoporosis. Both parents are alive and healthy, with no known
    history of similar conditions. At his previous encounter two months ago, his parents
    reported that he had been doing well, with no significant changes in his symptoms.

  text: A 10-year-old boy, Lucas Thompson, presents with complaints of mild clumsiness
    and difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as tying his shoelaces or buttoning
    his shirt, over the past six months. His parents report that he has been experiencing
    occasional episodes of double vision and has had a few instances of dislocating
    his shoulder during physical activities. On examination, his vital signs are within
    normal limits, with a temperature of 98.6°F, weight of 32 kg, height of 140 cm,
    and a body mass index of 18.5. His oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory
    evaluation shows a slightly elevated homocysteine level of 15 µmol/L, with normal
    levels of folate and vitamin B12. He is currently taking a daily multivitamin
    supplement as recommended by his pediatrician. His family history is notable for
    his mother having a history of blood clots during pregnancy, and his father has
    high blood pressure. Both parents are alive and healthy otherwise. During his
    previous encounter two months ago, Lucas had a normal eye examination, but his
    parents have since noticed an increase in his clumsiness, prompting this visit
    to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to his symptoms.

    and difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as tying his shoelaces or buttoning
    his shirt, over the past six months. His parents report that he has been experiencing
    some learning difficulties, particularly with math and reading comprehension,
    and has been noted to have a slight decrease in appetite. On examination, his
    vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 98.6°F, weight of
    32 kg, height of 140 cm, and a body mass index (BMI) of 16.2. His head circumference
    is measured at 54 cm, which is slightly below the 50th percentile. Oxygen saturation
    is 98% on room air. He exhibits mild bilateral lens dislocation, but his visual
    acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Laboratory results show a mildly elevated homocysteine
    level of 15 µmol/L and a methionine level of 25 µmol/L. His complete blood count
    and blood chemistry are within normal limits. He is currently not taking any medications.
    His family history is notable for a maternal uncle with a history of thrombotic
    events, and both parents are alive and healthy. Two years ago, Lucas was seen
    for a routine check-up, at which time his physical examination and laboratory
    results were unremarkable. Since then, his parents have noticed a gradual decline
    in his coordination and an increase in his frequency of falling.

  text: A 32-year-old woman, Sofia Rodriguez, presents with intermittent episodes
    of burning pain in her hands and feet, which she has been experiencing for the
    past five years. She reports that these episodes are often triggered by exercise
    or exposure to heat, and are accompanied by a sensation of tingling and numbness.
    Her vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius,
    weight of 58 kilograms, height of 165 centimeters, and a body mass index of 21.5.
    Laboratory evaluation shows a slightly elevated creatine kinase level at 180 U/L,
    with normal electrolyte and complete blood count results. She is currently taking
    acetaminophen as needed for pain relief, with a dosage of 500 milligrams every
    six hours. Sofia's family history is notable for her father having suffered from
    chronic kidney disease, and her mother having a history of hypertensive heart
    disease. Two years ago, Sofia was seen for a similar complaint, at which time
    her symptoms were attributed to overuse and she was advised to modify her exercise
    routine; since then, the frequency and severity of her episodes have increased.

    of burning pain in her hands and feet, which she has been experiencing for the
    past five years. She describes the pain as severe and debilitating at times, often
    triggered by exposure to heat or physical activity. Her vital signs are within
    normal limits, with a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, weight of 58 kilograms,
    height of 165 centimeters, and a body mass index of 21.5. She reports experiencing
    occasional gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea and abdominal pain,
    but these symptoms have been mild and self-limiting. Laboratory evaluation shows
    a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, but other renal function tests
    are normal. She is currently taking ibuprofen as needed for pain management, with
    a dosage of 400 milligrams every 6 hours. Sofia's family history is notable for
    her father having suffered from chronic kidney disease, but both parents are alive
    and otherwise healthy. During her previous encounter two years ago, she had reported
    similar symptoms, but they were less frequent and severe, and her laboratory results
    were largely unremarkable at that time.
