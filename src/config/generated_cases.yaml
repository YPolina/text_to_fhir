  text: A 38-year-old woman, Elena Vasquez, presents with complaints of gradual enlargement
    of her hands and feet over the past year, as well as occasional joint pains, particularly
    in her knees and wrists. She has noticed that her rings no longer fit and has
    had to purchase larger shoes. Her blood pressure is 128/80 mmHg, pulse 70 bpm,
    and BMI 26.5 kg/m². Laboratory results show a glucose level of 92 mg/dL, which
    is within normal limits, and an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level of
    420 ng/mL, slightly above the upper limit of the normal range for her age. She
    reports no significant weight changes but mentions an increase in sweating and
    mild fatigue. Her family history is notable for her father having type 2 diabetes,
    and both parents are alive and healthy, with no known history of similar complaints.
    Elena has been taking ibuprofen 400 mg as needed for her joint pains, with no
    reported side effects. She visited her primary care physician six months ago for
    a routine check-up, at which time her blood pressure was 120/75 mmHg, and no significant
    abnormalities were noted. Since then, she has experienced a gradual progression
    of her symptoms, prompting her to seek further evaluation.

    a neurological disorder of unknown etiology, and her mother has a history of psychiatric
    issues, though the exact nature is unclear. Both parents are alive, and there
    is no known consanguinity. Alexandra has been taking a multivitamin daily for
    the past year and reports no other medication use. She had a physical examination
