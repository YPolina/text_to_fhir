      A 36-year-old man, Andrei Petrov, presents with progressive enlargement of hands and feet,
      headaches, and excessive sweating over the past two years. He reports needing larger shoes
      and noticing coarsening of facial features. No visual field defects are reported.
      Laboratory evaluation shows elevated IGF-1 and impaired fasting glucose.
      On examination, he is overweight with increased head circumference.
      Family history is notable for diabetes in his father and hypertension in his mother.
      He was recently started on metformin for impaired glucose tolerance.
      Findings are consistent with early-stage acromegaly, likely due to a pituitary adenoma,
      though imaging is pending.

      A 34-year-old woman, Sofia Ivanova, reports subtle facial puffiness and mild fatigue over the past year.
      Her dentist noted increased interdental spacing, and she recently changed her ring size.
      She attributes her symptoms to weight gain and stress.
      Physical examination reveals slightly thickened skin and mild frontal bossing, but no visual changes.
      IGF-1 is mildly elevated; oral glucose tolerance test shows borderline suppression of GH.
      MRI is pending. Findings suggest early acromegaly likely due to a microadenoma.

      Patient Andrei Ivanov, a 16‑year‑old male, presented with complaints of persistent fatigue and occasional mild abdominal discomfort over the past three months. 
      His family noted a subtle yellowing of the eyes, though he denied pruritus, dark urine, or pale stools. 
      There was no history of alcohol intake, drug use, or significant past illness. Family history was negative for liver or neurological disease.
      On examination, Andrei appeared well nourished, with mild scleral icterus. 
      The liver edge was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin, smooth and mildly tender. 
      No splenomegaly was detected. Neurological examination revealed no tremor, dysarthria, or abnormal movements.
      Laboratory investigations showed mildly elevated transaminases, with ALT and AST both above the upper limit of normal, and a borderline increase in total bilirubin. 
      Serum ceruloplasmin was reduced at 12 mg/dL. 
      A 24‑hour urinary copper excretion was elevated at 150 µg/24h. 
      Hematological studies showed no evidence of hemolysis.
      Abdominal ultrasound confirmed mild hepatomegaly with preserved parenchymal echotexture.
      Ophthalmological slit‑lamp examination revealed early Kayser–Fleischer rings at the corneal periphery.
